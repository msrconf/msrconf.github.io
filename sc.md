The steering committee of the MSR conference provides general guidance and direction for the MSR conference and selects future GC and PC Chairs. 
The composition of the steering committee is as follows:

* Includes past PC chairs and GC for the past N-3 MSR conferences
* Includes any appointed future PC chairs and GC
* 2 members per year are selected by the attendees of the current MSR. 
* Up to 1-2 members per year can be selected by the SC to help the MSR SC grow in strategic areas. 

Example: The PC chair of MSR 2011 would rotate off at the end of the meeting at MSR 2014
