# Most Influential Papers

| Year | <!-- --> |
|-|-|
| 2017 | [How Long Will It Take to Fix This Bug?](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1269017) <br/> Cathrin Weiss, Rahul Premraj, Thomas Zimmermann, and Andreas Zeller <br/> "For paving the way of actionable software analytics." |

(MSR 2005)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083147) <br/> Jacek Sliwerski, Thomas Zimmermann, and Andreas Zeller <br/> "Prior software quality research focused on flagging files with bugs, but the SZZ algorithm by Sliwerski et al. was the first work to focus on flagging faulty changes. By flagging bugs before they get into the code, follow-up research has taken a preventive role instead of a catchup role." <br/>&nbsp;<br/> <b>Honorable Mention:</b> [Developer Identification Methods for Integrated Data from Various Sources](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083162) <br/> Gregorio Robles and Jesus M. Gonzalez-Barahona <br/> "For their pioneering efforts in mining social information. Such information has been the catalyst for many research efforts throughout software engineering."|
